This is my recreation of Tetris, made using Python.

For this to work properly, the user should type "pip3 install pygame" into their command prompt. If you cannot install pygame, then all lines of code that use it can be commented out and the game will work just fine; pygame is used only for sound.

CONTROLS:
Left/right arrow key: move block left or right
Down arrow key: move block down faster
Up arrow key: rotate block clockwise

M key: mute/unmute sound (can also be controlled in the "options" tab)
Spacebar: pause/play game (can also be controlled using the play/pause button)

I have not found any bugs, but if you find one feel free to let me know! Any advice in general is greatly appreciated :)
