This is my recreation of Tetris, made using Python. You can play the game by running "Tetris.py" in any IDE you have. You can also view the game on Replit, although the sound doesn't work: https://replit.com/@DawnNadeeka/Tetris

For this to work properly, the user should type "pip3 install pygame" into their command prompt. If you cannot install pygame, or if you recieve an error relating to highscores, then you can instead run "TetrisLite.py", which removes the sound and the recording of highscores.

CONTROLS:
Left/right arrow key: move block left or right
Down arrow key: move block down faster
Up arrow key: rotate block clockwise

M key: mute/unmute sound (can also be controlled in the "options" tab)
Spacebar: pause/play game (can also be controlled using the play/pause button)

I have not found any bugs, but if you find one feel free to let me know! Any advice in general is greatly appreciated :)
